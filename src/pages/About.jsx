                My passion for the beauty industry started when I was 19 & received my first facial treatment. I thought
                'wow this is how I want to make people feel' and I have now been a fully qualified Beauty Therapist &
                working in the beauty industry for over 17 years. I love making people look & feel amazing. I love my
                job & consider myself a natural at what I do. My most common compliments are 'best facial/massage ever',
                and my favorite massage compliment is 'incredible' & love it when clients describe my hands as 'magical'
                I absolutely love when people leave their eyebrows in my hands so I can work my magic as a brow artist,
                confident to work with both Male & female. I'm all for affordable treatments to all, so I am very
                pleased to be able to offer my treatments at home salon prices. I take the natural approach to skincare
                using only natural & organic products that give the best results and can be tailored to suit any skin
                type, perfect for those sensitive skin ranges. I have put my all into making my Beauty space as
                comfortable & peaceful & possible & can't wait to share with you the Tranquil experience that awaits you
